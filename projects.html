                    <p>The main aim of this project was to control different home appliances by using voice commands via voice assistant. By allowing users to control their homes with simple voice commands, voice-controlled home automation systems eliminate the need for users to physically interact with the equipment they use to control the environment.</p>

                    <p>This was a group project. We have practically implemented our knowledge of building a transformer. Our transformer was a single phase transformer of shell type. And the required rating was 220V/12V, 400VA. The finally we have get the almpost similar configuration as mentioned to the requirements.  </p>

                    <p>In this project we have designed a floor plan ourself. The conduit wiring was done based on the floor plan with the help of AutoCAD. We have calculated the required illumination and designed the electrical appliances based on it. We kept minimal costing for the overall wiring and it was around BDT 82298 as per the floor plan and requirements.</p>
